# Premier-League-Player-Stats
A web app made using Python and Streamlit that compares the statistics of players and shows the top performers in the Premier League for the 2019/20 season.

I have also deployed the app using Heroku. You can check it out <a href = "https://guarded-spire-56172.herokuapp.com/"> here </a>.

The data for the app was take from <a href = "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/stats/Premier-League-Stats"> here </a>.


To run the app locally, just clone the repository and make the following cahnges in the code before running the app:

1. Update the location of the image in line 7.
2. Update the dataset location in lines 22 and 97.

To run the app, open Windows Powershell/Command Line and type:

streamlit run code.py


If the "streamlit run code.py" gives an error:

Check whether the "code.py" file is present in the working directory or update your working directory to match the location where the "code.py" file is present.
